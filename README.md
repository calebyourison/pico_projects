# Raspberry Pi Pico Projects

---

Hardware projects that make use of the [Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#pico-1-family).

Prior to using these, you'll want to first install [micropython](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/1) on your device.

If you are just getting started with electronics and/or micropython, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with some of the basic concepts first. 
Some basic diagrams will be provided here to aid your learning.

**None of these projects are responsible for damage to your Pico due to improper wiring or other user error.**
